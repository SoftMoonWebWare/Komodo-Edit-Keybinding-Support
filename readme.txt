Komodo Edit is a free text-editor specifically designed for writing program code, and it makes an OK document editor also.  It has many command-shortcut-keybindings that allow you to press specific keystrokes to activate internal commands.  It also allows the user to create "macros" and "snippets," commands and strings of characters that can also be "bound" to a keystroke of the user's choice.  If you want to create your macros and snippets, you need to bind them to keystrokes that are not in conflict with Komodo's command-keybindings.  Komodo Edit will list the keybindings, but only by category.  It is much easier to keep track of where there is an unbound keystroke available if they are listed by key.

This PHP program will convert Komodo's "keybindings by category" HTML-output-dump-pagefile into an HTML page listing "keybindings by key".  It will highlight keybindings that conflict with each-other.  It can also compare and contrast different keybinding schemes.
It can also include a "groomed" version of the original "keybindings by category" tables with the keys dressed nice to read them, again showing conflicting keys and comparing/contrasting different schemes.  When the groomed category tables are included, page display options include one full page, side-by-side, or top-over-bottom stacked.
There is also a navigation menu with quick-click to each key, and if included, category tables.

Once you process your key bindings list with this PHP program, save the output HTML from the browser* (right click on the page and "save to file") to the file of your choice on your computer where you use Komodo Edit {*at the time of this writing, Google's Chrome will alter the link addresses when "saving HTML page to file" from a simple relative-to-page format ("#destID") to a complete absolute address (like "http://localhost/SoftMoon/Komodo/convert_keybindings_table.php#destID") and these links will then no longer work correctly when we later call this file using a "file://" URL as shown below.  Use Firefox to --create-- a static copy of these tables, which can then be --viewed-- in Chrome, the latter which at this time more fully supports the given HTML5.}.  Then open the folder where you just saved the file, and open the file you just saved in another window of your browser.  This will give you a "file://" URL in your browser's address bar; copy it to the clipboard.   In Komodo Edit's right-side-toolbar, where snippets, macros, etc. are stored, right-click and Add > New URL.  Paste the URL into the URL field.  I like to bind it to Alt+F1 for quick access; or you can just click on it in the toolbar.  This will quickly open the "keybindings by key" HTML table in your default browser without needing an active server/PHP setup (for as long as you don't change the bindings).
Firefox is my "default" system browser, but at this time of writing, "Blink" browsers (current Chrome, Opera) yield the best result when viewing the HTML5 output of this program.  To get Komodo Edit to open the static-copy saved as shown above in the specific browser of your choice, first locate that browser's .exe file on your computer.  Opera, for instance, is at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Opera\opera.exe" on my MS-WindowsÂ® system.  Then in Komodo's toolbar, create a new Macro similar to the following JavaScript:

ko.browse.openUrlInDefaultBrowser(
 "file:///C:/Users/user/documents/Komodo/keybindings_by_key.htm",
 "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Opera\\opera.exe" );

Note above how we must double the backslashes in the path-to-Browser because the backslash is an escape character in JavaScript strings.
